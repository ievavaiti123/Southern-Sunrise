    <p>Color of <span id="lemon">lemon</span>, <span id="mango">mango</span>, <span id="peach">peach</span>,
        <br>
        These story book villas 
        <br>
        Still dream <a href="#">behind</a>
        <br>
        Shutters, their balconies
        <br>
        Fine as hand-
        <br>
        Made lace, or a leaf-and-flower <a href="#">pen-sketch</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="italic">Tilting</span> with the <span class="wide">winds</span>,
        <br>
        On arrowy stems,
        <br>
        Pineapple-barked,
        <br>
        A <span class="green">green</span> crescent of palms
        <br>
        Sends up its forked
        <br>
        Firework of fronds.
    </p>

    <p>
        A quartz-clear dawn
        <br>
        Inch by <span id="bright">bright Inch</span>
        <br>
        Gilds all our Avenue,
        <br>
        And out of the blue drench
        <br>
        Of Angels' Bay
        <br>
        Rises the round <span id="watermelon">red watermelon sun</span>.
    </p>
